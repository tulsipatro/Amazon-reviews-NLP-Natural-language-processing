It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\n\nThis magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\n\nAntiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\n\nThe writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.\n\nOverall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.", "summary": "Antiques Magazine is Good, but not for Everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1174694400}

That makes it very easy to read while at the same time it is imparting in-depth technical know-how.\n\n If you are a newbie, in no time you possess expert knowledge of computers and, to an extent, of electronics.\n\nIf you are already advanced, then you get even more advanced. Period.\n\nAs an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.\n\nFor instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.\n\nYou become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.\n\nThere are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!\n\nI also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.\n\nThere are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.\n\nYou also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.\n\nOverall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.\n\nI have the kindle for Ipad version, and it is the absolute best.

The magazine's writing and tone always felt just about right and in the days before Internet, was the only way to actually get good information about hardware.

And to the writers credit, they have changed content slightly to highlight articles that do not suffer from a few months delay.\n\nI work in a circulation department for another magazine and I get all the frustration magazine customers have at slow delivery, fulfillment of old issues and all those many many ads. My only defense is where else can you get an hour (or so) entertainment for 42 cents a month? Even double that price is still an insanely low price for such quality content.\n\nI'm glad I'm back on board after all these years. Sure I have the Internet for the day 1 reviews of new hardware launches and 10 page articles on tweaks to get 1 FPS more out of Skyrim but truthfully my patience for that type of involvement with my computer has dropped considerably.

At the top of the page is a sentence stating that you must call a certain phone number to cancel or change subscriptions. So those two buttons are... the modern day racing stripes for a web site with no function at all, mererly appearance?

And Details is not a magazine that seems to have its hand on the\npulse of the nation. More often than not, you skim through, looking for something interesting to read, and close it finding none. And in a men's interest/fashion magazine, nothing is more important than the photos. Unfortunately they are not that great. The photo spreads are way too short. But since the photographers have taken amatuerish or just poorly done\nphotographs, it actually works out. Basically what you have with\nDetails is a magazine that wants to be one of the big boys, but hasn't found a way to get there.

I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it's those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.\nNow, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.\nNow, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven't finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven't finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, \"when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue.\" Now, this is B.S. They are holding back on my last 2 issues that I paid for until they receive my payment. What if I did NOT want to renew this magazine? Does this mean I do not get my last 2 issues (Oct. & Nov. 2010) that I paid for? This is not fair business practices!!! They are still obligated to still send me my last 2 issues regardless if I renew or not. I am a little angered here. Yes, I like the magazine for obvious reasons and I will renew; but this is not fair at all! This is some deceptive marking trick to keep you subscribed and keep you paying to receive all your issues you already paid for!", "summary": "It Is A Good Magazine, But They Have Sly Renewal Practices.", "unixReviewTime": 1282262400}

As some of the other reviewers have noted, a huge portion of the magazine is taken up with glossy advertising, most of which is for clothing that only investment bankers or movie stars are likely to purchase. I like clothes, but it would be nice to see clothing lines other than couture advertised. More disturbingly, the magazine seems to have a split personality in its approach to masculinity. Many articles are written from the viewpoint of the stereotypical uber-masculine American male, with lots of references to heterosexual relationships, and other \"guy stuff.\" Yet other articles come off as attempting to be from a gay-friendly viewpoint. I prefer the latter, but I don't see the point in having gay-friendly material when the rest of the magazine is trying to be a go-to guide for red-blooded males. I guess I don't fully \"get\" the editorial viewpoint that Details (purports to be) espousing.

Both of those resources are free, and have the resource material I need to learn to play a song. Bass Player typically only has one bass transcription per issue. If I could actually play some of those transcriptions, maybe I would feel more positive about it. But Bass Player typically picks songs with complicated bass lines that are beyond my ability.

Dont think that you little mall-core kids are not rep'd...all the nu-metal low enders are there as well, even though they suck the rust from under my fretwire.

The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\n\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\n\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\n\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\n\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.\n\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\n\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\n\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.", "summary": "Give Me the Details", "unixReviewTime": 1142380800}

I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions.

I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages.

This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\n\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\n\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\n\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.", "summary": "Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment", "unixReviewTime": 1190592000}

Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.\n\nThere are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC's and PC components, a \"Watchdog\" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an \"Ask the Doctor\" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.\n\nMy favorite is the how-to's in just about every issue.  All of the how-to's show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a \"write down to the lowest level\" nor a \"technogeek know-it-all\" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many \"secrets\" you won't read in mainstream computer magazines.\n\nAnd the reviews.  I love the \"Kick-A**\" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn't meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.\n\nThis product is managed by the same people who do \"PC Gamer\" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.\n\nTheir writing style isn't for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.\n\nRecommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.

I have to admit that the article on building your own super PC made me want to do just that, although I would opt for the budget version, which they also included in the article.

For instance, they talk\n  about Raid 0 & Raid +0 and the benifits of running such a\n  setup, but it would be nice if they would devote a section of\n  \"step-by-step\" instructions on how to do a raid config, with\n  new HDs and installing a new OS, or if it can be done with\n  your current OS installed.\n6. Tweaks, tweaks and more tweaks. Simple (to them) the best way\n  to configure your cabling with IDE HDs, CD Roms, CD-RW, DVE+\n  RWs, Zip drives, etc.\n7. How the heck to you get Advanced Power Management to work\n  properly? I've tried setting it up in the BIOS. If you don't\n  enable it in BIOS, before loading a \"clean install\" of your\n  OS some features are not available, when you try to configure\n  it in Windows. For that matter, every time I try to set it up\n  in Windows, then save the \"profile\" it tells me \"one or more\n  of the settings are incompatible\". I've never been able to\n  get a PC to \"hybrinate\" or go to sleep, where all the fans\n  power down. Maybe I'm just dumb.\n8. THIS IS THE BIGGIE. I've talked to a lot of HCGs, and they\n  all (well all but one of 23) said they thought the inclusion\n  of a monthly feature for \"DUMMIES\" would be a good choice.\n  For example: Several people told me that when they run Si-\n  Soft's Sandra, Win98se OS, they get a recommendation to \"turn\n  Double Buffering off\". Proble is, they cant find anyplace to\n  do it. They looked in Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat,\n  even the registry, but no DBLBUFF.SYS (SP?) exists. They\n  finally just remove the file from the \"Windows\\System\"\n  directory & upon re-booting, they get an error that it isn't\n  loaded because it's missing or corrupt. I could go on and on.\n9. I would be happy to write the article (for a probationary\n  period, to check reader response, then when Maximum PC gets\n  overwhelming positive responses and sales increase, we can\n  talk about some type of compensation that would be fair to\n  all parties.\nIn spite of all the \"nit pickin\" I listed, Maximum PC is still the most excitingly entertaining PC magazine there is. I get my monthly subscription and it is all I can do to (not drop everything I'm doing) to start reading. I usually save it for bedtime, because (if I've had a bad day) MaxPC immediatly makes everything better. It is definatly a \"Kicka__ Magazine.\nI am curious as to why you don't offer the subscription with the CD. Becuase everyone I know gets the CD. Is it that the price would not be much better than the one offered in the mag?\nMy worst nightmares are, they will discontinue Maxamum PC>", "summary": "Maximum Computer Geek, Begenner []", "unixReviewTime": 1049932800}

While many of the well-known players in this field (especially the ones with \"PC\" in their name) have dedicated increasing portions of their magazines to business-related topics, Maximum PC has stayed true to the cause of helping the individual home enthusiast or expert get the most from his machine. If you want to read about B2B apps, corporate firewalls, or XML, look elsewhere, but if you want comprehensive reviews of the latest hardware and software written for people who don't need a tutorial to rename a file on their PC or insert a chart into an Excel file, look no further.\nIf you're the sort of person who builds his own machine or is thinking of doing so, Maximum PC will likely prove itself useful to you. Likewise for those planning to do their own hardware upgrades. And if you're like me and just like to stay aware of and knowledgeable about current products and technologies then this is still an excellent and informative read.\nTo be fair, there are a few features that may be displeasing to some readers. The writing is occasionally glib with a tendency towards sophomoric humor. There's also a fair amount of focus on gaming, particularly 3D gaming technology. And the overriding theme of much of the magazine is maximizing the speed, power, and coolness of your machine. To me these aren't negative qualities, but this may not be of interest to some users.\nAll in all this is still my favorite magazine and the one I most look forward to receiving each month.

Most, in general, feature the same articles month after month, and therefore become repetitive and boring.  Let's face it: there is only so much you can take reading about \"The Best Bedroom Moves\" issue after issue.  Allure, however, never seems dull or filled with useless amounts of recycled information.\n\nI began subscribing to the magazine at age 18 (I'm 23 now) and have never been disappointed.  Allure has articles for every age, and I find relevant information for my life, body, and health, and then I am able to find information that will interest and benefit my 50+ year old mother.  Perhaps that is part of the appeal of the magazine: any age group can enjoy it.  Not many magazines can say that.\n\nUnlike many other female-geared magazines, Allure offers more than just underwear pictures and \"how to please your man\" articles.  Each issue, Allure has an entire section dedicated to new health science discoveries, such as new updates about skin cancer and sleep problems. The magazine seems genuinely about women, beauty, and health, whereas other magazines make some feminists role their eyes (\"how to please your man,\" anyone?)\n\nLike anything else, Allure has its downfalls.  While I do appreciate the make-up, weightloss, and fashion tips, I still always feel that I can never quite live up to the expectation the magazine presents me.  I'm a pretty girl in good physical health, and I still- at times- feel inadequate when reading the many awesome articles of this magazine.\n\nOverall, I recommend Allure highly to women of all ages, shapes, and sizes.  It contains more than just the bubbly sextalk of most female magazines, and therefore you get more zest for your money.", "summary": "Something for Women of All Ages", "unixReviewTime": 1231459200}

I love it in principle -- a magazine devoted to beauty with a heavy focus on makeup. The content, however, is short on how-to and long on buy-this-product. Much of the makeup is expensive and exclusive, unavailable to the majority of the buying public. They're constantly raving over products that are quite frankly terrible, to the point where seeing Allure recommend something actually makes me less likely to try it. The fashion spreads are pointless and would be better left out, focusing on expensive items, unwearable trends, or flash-in-the-pan fads. The \"Makeup Colors\" technique is always frustrating, as the listed products never even resemble the actual look achieved. This problem is worsened by the fact that the colors of featured products rarely render true on the pages; I get sick of buying a cosmetic product only to find the color looks nothing like the way it looked on the page. It swings wildly between trends and recommendations with no apparent sense of coherence to it; its advice frequently contradicts itself from one month to the next. Finally, its focus on fluffy celebrity, name brand clothes, and rich-and-famous lifestyles (it's obsessed with recommending clothes and etiquette for red-carpet \"parties\" of the kind I can't begin to relate to) leads the average reader to develop a massive inferiority complex.\n\n Skip this one and go for Lucky for versatile fashion advice, the most important makeup tips and trends, and a wider range of ages, hairstyles, and races on the models than the bland-beautiful-young-white-girl Allure favors.", "summary": "So much promise, so little result", "unixReviewTime": 1090454400}

One of \"Allure\"'s greatest strengths is that they don't pander to any makeup company or brand; they are upfront about what works and what doesn't.

ARTnews is a quick read, lots of things happemn between its coevers, and it seems to be of more interest to working artsts than to the big gun collectors and museums.

Used to be a subscriber in years past. Magazine tends to repeat articles, just change them up a bit year to year. I like the new tool blurbs. This is my warning, not noted in the above price/issues per year info. When I subscribed, you got 10 issues per year. As of now (Feb 2017) they only publish 8 issues per year. Magazine is dying, trying to keep itself afloat. Also they send out offers for handyman books. If you do not return the invoice cancelling the shipment, the book will be sent and then you either pay or have to deal with shipping it back. If you just toss the notice as junk mail you will be surprised when the book shows up. I will not be renewing when it is time, since I can check it out at my local library or read online through various apps.\n\nOne last gripe. The topic of some articles is beyond the scope of this type of magazine. This is geared toward homeowners, not professional contractors. But in the current issue(March 2017) there is an article starting on page 24  and goes to page 31 title Best Pro Tips Avoid Framing Tips.

She turned it into a Cosmo clone with lots of \"how to please your man in bed\" articles and other sex related features.  The magazine was obsessed with sex, to the point that I quit reading it until a year or two ago.\n\nNowadays there are fewer sex articles, though more than I would like.  I do like the fact that Glamour covers a variety of topics.  There's something for just about everyone.  The dos and don'ts are fun, as well as the feature where a person does something really ridiculous to see how people respond.  I will say that at 38 I'm starting to feel that I'm outgrowing the magazine a little bit.  A lot of the articles seem to be targeted at someone younger than me.  I'm not sure how much longer I will continue my subscription, but I do think this is one of the better women's magazines for gals in their 20s to mid 30s.\n\nOne warning about Conde Nast magazines:  when you purchase a new subscription, they send you two old magazines from previous months, and count them against your subscription.  I really dislike this practice.  It has happened with every Conde Nast magazine I've subscribed to.  Also, I often receive my magazine well after it has appeared on the newsstand.

It's dynamic- it doesn't just focus on one topic, but many! Glamour has something for everyone, be it makeup tips or clothes for your body type, work out regimes, sex tips, and articles on global issues.  Yes, some of the articles can be a bit repetitive, but come on, your reading a magazine, not a Shakespearean novel.\nI love the articles by Marianne Pearl.  She is traveling the world for Glamour, writing stories about social issues in our world.  Not only are the articles well written, but they are uplifting and give light to problems that the media often ignores.\nThe Glamour Beauty section focuses on tips for applying makeup for the current season and fun hairstyles to try.  Glamour Fashion has clothes that are mostly affordable for the everyday woman and it's fun to look at all the different styles.  In addition, there is always a \"Do and Don't\" section which shows people wearing both ridiculous and chic outfits. The Men, Sex, and Love section usually has a Do and Don't section as well, and advice for women written by real men.  Sometimes the celebrity interview can be a bit bland- they are often just promoting a new CD or movie, but others have been quite interesting.  This section is often hit or miss.\nWhat I like best about Glamour is the Real Stories section.  There is always a page about an everyday hero, which is uplifting to read.  Plus, usually a celebrity will tell about a transforming time in his or her life.\nI love that Glamour isn't like every other magazine.

And the advertisements don't rule the magazine. They are placed in the magazine to enhance its already dynamic appeal. The magazine is so well balanced that after reading it, one cannot help but feel deeply satisfied. Glamour incorporates monthly,  beauty, fashion, religion, political, economical, and health, trends and details. All of which are researched professionally and veracious. If you are searching for a woman's magazine and like intelligent and fun articles, which have well designed layouts, Glamour is the magazine for you!", "summary": "GLAMOURAMA", "unixReviewTime": 1209772800}

The previous reviews were a little bit out of date here on Amazon, and in my opinion, a magazine can transform dramatically in a year, if not less. There's definitely a lot less fluff and a lot of wonderful articles in 2005.  For example, there were articles about the emotional hardships with a mom whose kid is mentally ill and the story of up coming star as a happily adopted child. There were articles on women who struggled so that girls today can play in Little League, women can get credit cards and keep their job when they get pregnant.  There's a lot of important and powerful article on women's rights with a dose of celebrity life.  My favorite article was Aisha Tyler showing us how much digital touchup can do to cover models....it definitely made me feel a lot better about my body.\n\nI felt like Glamour had enough dosage with fashion, health news, beauty tips, and celebrity life, but still did a great job to remind us the greatness of being a woman. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I had flip through 6 pages of ads before I got to the table on contents. I suppose that's how magazines make their money, but I can do without.

I missed the more intelligent magazine of my earlier years and considered cancelling my subscription, but because I was still deriving some enjoyment from the entertainment features, I continued reading.  A few years ago, a new editor, Cynthia Leive, took over, and since then, there has been another--although less dramatic--transformation.

For the past couple years, though, the quality seems to have really dropped and I have decided to cancel my subscription.\n\nThere seems to be a much larger focus on graphics taking up the pages instead of written content (it's not uncommon for 2/3+ of a given page to be graphics or photos with a single paragraph of text). And there seems to be more material directed toward the 'internet culture' sort of crowd, which I don't care for. If I wanted to read cutesy things about surviving a zombie apocalypse (I don't) I would be doing so on the internet already. The general quality of writing seems to have become much more simplified and less in depth. I get it, it's Popular Science, not a scientific journal. But I remember the quality of writing being much higher not a few years ago. It's trying to compete with the internet now the magazine feels like a website in print, complete with readers' tweets.\n\nThe ads seem more bothersome and invasive now. The last issue I received started off with a double page ad and a single page ad, both before the contents page. This issue had 26 pages worth of ads out of the 103 pages total (not including 'articles' gushing over new products), and some of them are sneaky ads too. There was a double page ad made to look an article with no written indication that it was an ad (older issues I still have clearly printed 'ADVERTISEMENT' along the top of the page).\n\nThis is not something I personally care about, but it's worth mentioning that there are ads for both tobacco and alcohol products in Popular Science and there have been for some time. In fact, the double page ad I mentioned earlier which starts off the last Issue I received was for Skoal dipping tobacco. The very first thing you see when you open the magazine. So look out if you buy this for your children to read and don't want to expose them to that sort of advertising.\n\nThey also REALLY seem to be pushing the global warming thing.

If others in the media censor their opinions in the face of big brother, Harper's makes up for it with brutally honest assessments of culture, politics, and world affairs.\nAt first look, Harper's seems a leftist publication, but if you read it a little more carefully, it's a lot more Mark Twain than Karl Marx.  I'd call it centrist, but even that implies straddling the center between two extremes.  Like Twain, Harper's is more of a somewhat irascible, yet always caring voice on the outside, not on one end of the spectrum or another, but rather on a different spectrum altogether.\nThe attitude is egalitarian, never pompous.  The voices are reasonable, if sometimes angry or alarmed.  Harper's is definitely not a liberal magazine in the sense of Marxist socialism.  Harper's is liberal in the sense of Jeffersonian liberalism.  It's opinions seem more focused on improving local cultures and economies and challenging the demagogues and central planners who seek to control the masses, be they Democrat or Republican.  Perhaps Harper's is the Jim Jeffords of the magazine world.\nHarper's is an eloquent and impassioned magazine that delivers carefully constructed and inventive views of the world each month.  There is an overriding sense of seriousness and genuine compassion found in every issue.  In a world where so many media sources are merely parrots for a larger corporate or political agendas, Harper's stands out as an autonomous voice of indignant opposition to censorship and blind nationalism.  If you care about the world we all inhabit and genuinely want to discover how we might all get to a better place, give Harper's a read.  It may not provide the answers, but it certainly raises all the right questions.", "summary": "Best Magazine on the Newsstand", "unixReviewTime": 1018569600}

Martin", "reviewText": "Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the \"Men's Health\" is not written for me.\n\nThe world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, \"Men's Health\" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?\n\nI had been meaning to pick up an issue of \"Men's Health Magazine\" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.\n\n\"Men's Health Magazine,\" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today \"Men's Health Magazine\" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.\n\nThe problem with \"Men's Health\" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.\n\nAnd yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?\n\nI have come to the conclusion the \"Men's Health\" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of \"Men's Health\" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?

I guess it's not fair to judge Harper's by a magazine that it isn't. They've had some great narrative essays, about a country veterinarian and ocean treasure hunting, for example. But they've also had a meandering (long) piece on college by the supposedly great author Marilynne Robinson. If that's her usual writing style, I can't imagine reading one of her novels. I wish Harper's could keep the caliber up from issue to issue, and perhaps choose topics a touch more interesting. And don't get me started on the book reviews.

The magazine of my youth has been ruined in all the ways  that matter to me. The only conclusion that I can come to is that the owners are simply trying to bleed it dry on what remains of it's well earned high regard to laymen as well as people in the field and education. The subscription was only a few dollars, that's not the real loss, the real loss is to all of us, the personal loss of looking forward to detailed articles, which are actually researched to some extent on occasion, of the most cutting edge and interesting science has to offer and then studying them when they arrive, making notes, highlighting portions to research and coming to conclusions, learning, being moved by a topic that is even more near and dear after I'm finished.

The authors and layout staff have definitely made Men's Health a pleasure to read.\n\nUnfortunately, over the last couple of years that I have noticed, the parent company, Rodale has been engaging in some fairly poor business practices. First off, they love to send random hardcover books to you and charge you for them without you ever really consenting to it. There is basically no way for you to ship back the books without costing a fortune on shipping fees. To my knowledge, there is no option of opting out of this.\n\nAlso, unlike a lot of other normal magazines, Rodale never gives you the option of renewing your subscription. They pretty much just send you a bill at the end of your original renewal period and charge you for the next period automatically. If you do not respond they will send your debt to a collection agency and that is a whole different nightmare to deal with.\n\nOf course I'm sure if we all read that thing we signed before subscribing to the magazine that there will be a section in small print informing us that Rodale can do whatever it wants. In that aspect, it is indeed my fault for letting them take advantage of me but I have recently canceled my subscription and never plan to subscribe again until Rodale decides to change its policies.", "summary": "Good content, Bad business", "unixReviewTime": 1249776000}

Smith", "reviewText": "A few years ago I was looking for a magazine to subscribe to and was drawn to the extremely positive reviews of Harper's. Have now been subscribing for several years straight. I do not consider myself really high brow, so I am probably not adequate to the task of reviewing a magazine, but I will do my best. The writing in this is super high quality--it appears the most important consideration for anything published in the magazine is the quality of the prose. I don't know where they find their writers--I imagine a very small number would be capable of writing for this magazine. I believe the first piece I ever read in Harper's was one written by a former archeology student who visited some of the old abandoned movie sets from the Star Wars movies. I remember being blown away by the high register of the vocabularly and the fantastic story telling and the extremely clever premise. The writing in the magazine often approaches the poetic. Personally I like the nonfiction pieces, esp. on politics and pop culture, and generally have not taken the time to read the fiction offerings or the reviews. I assume the magazine editors would identify the magazine as trying to reach a quite liberal audience. I am independent politically but do not find myself turned off by the magazine, as I am by political talk radio/TV. There are certainly pieces of political advocacy in here, but in my opinion the arguments are nuanced enough, with recognition of counterarguments, that reading this is not like listening to one-sided garbage such as we will find from Limbaugh, Hannity, Maddow, and their ilk. The writers generally recognize there are no simple solutions. For example, a piece in which an undercover writer examined food inspection practices in a slaughterhouse ended with the writer eating and more or less enjoying a steak--not the regular expose piece. I must admit that I most like the Harper's \"index\" and the readings at the beginning, especially the readings included for their irony or unintentional humor. Frankly, if I subscribed to Atlantic or the New Yorker I would probably read a greater perctange of those magazines because those mags do not seem quite as high brow, but I cannot deny the quality of Harper's.", "summary": "Super high-quality writing", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600}

I've picked up a random issue for review, September 2007 to be exact.  So here goes...\n\nThe GOOD:  The articles in here are well-written for the most part, and many of them are related to actual health.  This issue, which features an odd dual-issue format with Jamie Foxx on one cover and Andy Samberg from SNL on the back, has an article about the decline in testosterone (good) and stories about cooking healthier (also good).  Some of the ads in this issue are geared toward men too, such as the Ford Super Duty and Jeep ads.\n\nThe BAD:  In my opinion, there's *way* too much focus on fashion in this magazine.  It's bad on normal months, but this issue has a whole section donated to it (the back, upside-down section).  They seem to want me to buy a $750.00 pair of ugly Beatles-boots and by far the ugliest watch I've ever seen, the Zenith Defy Xtreme Open for $29,700.00.  Not sure who this magazine is catering to but I bought a subscription to learn more about healthy living.  There are entire magazines out there devoted to the type of guy who has money to burn and cares so much about a certain image (in otherwords, a poser).  I didn't expect it from this magazine.  And it's not that I want to tell this magazine what it should or shouldn't be... it's just that I don't want any part of this whole image thing.  You can buy some great high-quality and functional men's items without going overboard with materialism, and I don't want a magazine that promotes that.\n\nThe UGLY:  That Zenith watch takes the cake.  Seriously, look it up online.  It looks like something from a cereal box.  I might wear it if it was free, but I'd have to wear long sleeves to cover it up.  A watch shouldn't cost more than a new car.  If it does... you're a poser :)\n\nOverall:  This magazine has some good fatures but it's too fashion-oriented for my tastes.", "summary": "Not what I expected.", "unixReviewTime": 1209254400}

So too many advertisements along with weaker content was enough to steer me away.\n\nIn addition, ever since they brought on the new editor they have had a lot of junky stuff added. Too much relationship stuff and the Jimmy the bartender segment could be thrown out. Seems like it was made for very young men.\n\nI'm also not fond of their involuntary preferred customer program, where they automatically sign you up for the following year. It wouldn't be too bad if their online system worked, but it didn't work the 3 times I tried. If you;re going sing-up someone automatically at least give them the special discount.\n\nNever give them your credit card because they'll do whatever they can to avoid you canceling and you'll automatically be signed-up for renewal.", "summary": "Men's Health Reader for over 10 years (but not anymore)", "unixReviewTime": 1196553600}

Usually a magazine will pick one side or the other and completely turn me off of it, I think its better that they just stay out of it all together.  One last little bit of info, there arnt a whole lot of ad's, as compared to other magazines.

I'm not a thrift store shopper but I don't spend over $700 on one outfit either.\n\nNot to be all negative I have to admit there are some issues that really rock like the interview with Thomas Jane about his Punisher workout and the article about physical requirements of dangerous jobs like Marines, Army, SWAT, FBI, etc.\n\nI just don't feel that it is worth what they are charging.

Barricklow(Scaramouche)", "reviewText": "Lewis H. Lapham was the reason I initially subscribed to Harper's. His template and influence is still present. I enjoy my reading hobby and this magazine touches a lot of my reading hot buttons.\n Investigative reporting is my red meat hot botton. Perhaps the best book on that subject is Into The Buzzsaw by Kristina Borjesson. If one reads that, than one understands, what they need to know about a \"free press\". Despite those draw backs(read the book), Harper's manages to touch some hot wires that are ever present in today's envirnoment of elaborate PR facades. For example, the \"global warming' that is allegedly caused by carbon dioxide. Read(google)/ Climate Change: There's Money To Be Made by Ken Silverstein Harper's.\n Another hot botton of mine is books/literature, and Harper's not only reviews several books, but selects some for very in-depth anaylses.\n Another hot button of mine is science and they have a feature, every month: Findings, which is quite good(short but sweet). Also, some articles, at times, feature science stories.\n Another great feature they have every month is their \"Index\" feature, which relates some factual statistics on current topics that are in the public eye.\n Another feature is \"Readings\", which is an eclectic assortment of various odds & ends that cover things that one would never imagine to come across.\n Perhaps one of the most outstanding reasons to subscribe is Harper's provides access to its vast archives, dating back to 1850! I accessed an article that noted historian Charles Beard wrote in December 1931 titled 'The Myth of Rugged American Individualism'. In it he documented 15 examples of government handouts/subsidies to business when the country was sinking into Depression. It demolished the notion that business had single-handedly achieved the building of the country(or even its own special projects)due to the acumen and strength of character of big American entreneurs, revealing the extent to which government (as funded by the taxpayer) was not just instrumental, but an indespensable participant. Government was engaged in these projects in such a way that corporations were primary beneficiaries to the detriment of the public-such as the elaborate construction of networks of highways favoring the auto industry and Big Oil instead of cheap public transit. The giant businesses have enjoyed tremendous benefits while commanding public policy agenda, distorting public policy priorities and expendatures in ways that are not in (or even against) the public interest. And then, even as they reap immense government subsidies, they have the audacity to preach 'individualism' and self-sufficientcy to the American public, to tell Americans that we should demand nothing /expect nothing from the government we elected to address OUR NEEDS.\n This article of the past is representative of what a magazines should writing today. Unfortunately, it is NOT the case.\n\n All in all, a very worthwhile magazine in today's mainstream media full of emptiness.", "summary": "A Literary Magazine/ Investigative Journalism/&Eclectic Reading", "unixReviewTime": 1312243200}

At best they have articles about people in science or about social issues related to science, but always very shallow, even on these issues. It is not there is no depth in the science, there is no popular science at all. I was particular confused by an article from the new editor in chief in which he basically chose to describe his vacation in China, along with pictures of the westerners he met in various burger joints. He managed to throw in some technical words in there like \"energy\" and \"force\" but NEVER in their technical scientific meanings. This is incompetent and unprofessional.

On the other hand, if you meditate and have some degree of intuition, you don't need all that advice, it's common sense.\n\nMHM and Rodale press could just publish one workout book every decade, as \"breakthroughs\" don't happen very often in the realm of physical training.

It covers fitness, diet, health (it is very big on prevention and self-diagnosis early, so as to avoid major health problems later), fashion (good stuff, trendy and basic, not latest-from-Paris kinds of stuff), relationships (carefully sneaked into a magazine that looks like it isn't about relationships -- clever, because men don't read magazines about relationship tips), finance, and other topics that come up. There are brief articles on each of these (this is the magazine I read while standing over the kitchen sink eating breakfast -- articles tend to be brief enough to finish in that period of time), and I appreciate the witty, upbeat style that is not pompous or pretentious, just good basic 'guy stuff'.\n\nAlas, in each issue there is at least one article on 'how to drop five pounds this week' or 'how to lose 10 pounds by Easter' -- these look like they'll work and seem very reasonable, but I cannot comment on their effectiveness (would that I were able to!). I can comment on the effectiveness of time management, basic financial planning, and exercise routine advice -- these have worked for me. In fact, I credit many of the articles in this magazine with helping me to plan a graceful exit from my old job and into my new self-employment career and graduate school/seminary endeavour, by illustrating stories and giving useful advice.\n\nThere are also fun things, too, like a recent issue's back-page article on how to effectively tan, by the tan-master himself, George Hamilton. Do you know how to tie a bow-tie? This magazine had an article showing that, too.\n\nThis is not an 'in-depth' magazine, but then again, it doesn't pretend to be. Many of us work and live in a world that doesn't permit time-consuming research and consideration of essays on health and fitness, unless we are professional in that field. Thus, magazines like this fill a need. So far as health and fitness magazines are concerned, this one is a good one -- many magazines are veiled soft-core erotica. Men's Health does not avoid the topic of sex, but doesn't overplay it the way many do.\n\nThe magazine has a good graphic sense to it -- it illustrates the physical things discussed in photographs without as much embellishment as many other fitness magazines. Comparing this to several others on the magazine rack, it is understated, has less flash and more substance in the articles.\n\nDefinitely worth a look!", "summary": "A positive influence", "unixReviewTime": 1055203200}

In the brief product review, Harper's is described as liberal and left-leaning.  In my opinion, if it were to lean any farther, it would topple over.\n\nI've subscribed to Harper's for several years now, and will continue to do so when my current subscription runs out in the Spring.  Over this time, I've been continually impressed with the magazine's consistancy and broad ranging articles.  It also seems to believe that its readers have longer attention spans than what it takes to read a postage stamp, and so it's never felt the need to follow the current trend of wasting two or more introductory pages crammed full of paragraph-sized teaser articles and sidebars. (See National Geographic, Scientific American, American Scholar, and just about the entire issue of The Writer).\n\nIn any given issue of Harper's, you will find:\n\nThe Index - a collection of statistics that tell their own story,\n\nThe Reporter's Notebook - A spotlight soapbox,\n\nReadings - a collection of short essays, fiction, memoir, transcripts, etc. of wide and varying interests,\n\nReview of New Books,\n\nA critical in-depth essay on some facet of Art or Literature,\n\nFiction,\n\nA memoir or a travelogue,\n\nAnd cover stories that address the political and social climate in America.\n\nI don't agree with everything Harper's puts forth - as I said, their politics are plainly worn on their sleeve, and I think the Reporter's Notebook column is little more than a forum for griping by a revolving coterie of journalists.  At times elitist (though far less since Lewis Lapham's influence has waned) and perhaps open to the claim they write from an ivory tower, it is also smart, funny, immensely engaging, informative, and above all, thought provoking.  Even if I'm at odds with the view of a particular article, the occasion is an opportunity to redefine to myself where I do stand on the subject.  As someone who believes himself to be centrally positioned socially and politically, neutral on many of the hot-button issues of today, and fiscally conservative, Harper's still manages to entertain and engage on a regular basis.\n\nSadly, the author of my favorite recurring column, John Leonard, died late last year.  He reviewed new books, and it was from his column that I learned of many of my own choices throughout that time.  I can only hope that the new reviewer will share at least some of the same qualities that Mr. Leonard did.\n\nLastly, if you are able to complete the puzzle in the back, then you are a far smarter person than I.  I've subscribed for over three years, and I think I can count on one hand how many clues I've figured out.\n\nRecommended for the open-minded.", "summary": "Consistant and thought-provoking", "unixReviewTime": 1235260800}

Personally I prefer the Atlantic, which I read regularly, only picking up Harper's when I have time and something in it interests me, which is usually two or three times a year.\n\nJust looking at the cover and pages inside convey Harper's as a serious tome, perhaps too serious for the casual reader, especially compared to the more colorful pages of the Atlantic and playful New Yorker cartoons.  Nevertheless, Harper's is an American icon in it's genre having published many articles from great names since it's inception in 1850.\n\nA number of reviewers complain about it being left leaning and that stance clearly sprouts from the now recently departed editor Lewis Lapham, who has been an outspoken critic of the current administration.  Mr. Lapham shares his views in a two page opinion piece and in the full page listing of various \"fun facts\" known as the Harper's Index.  Serious readers will be able to get beyond this as simply a \"viewpoint\" and see the entire magazine for the serious writing that it is.  I would contend this represents the best in \"critical analysis\" rather than bias.  I would also simply suggest you view the other reviews made by people espousing this periodical as overly biased.  For instance, at least one of those claiming liberal bias here is also praising an Ann Coulter book.\n\nSo if you feel underwhelmed by the typical content you get even in a 60 minute broadcast or a political round table free-for-all and you're interested enough in this magazine to read it's reviews, you should probably pick up a copy of it for two or three months and give it a try.

I am also curious as to why there is an article that is Physics Girls youtube video from a year ago about vortex rings in water.

Lapham's style and vocubalary are extraordinary, and his writing is often laced with biting satire.\nThe magazine is illustrated with contemporary art from galleries across the United States, and includes informative features like the \"Harper's Index\" and the \"Readings\" section (garnered from documents in the public domain).  Each issue usually includes two serious book reviews, sometimes stretching across several pages of small, dense type.\nA subscription to this indispensible magazine will enlighten and entertain, equipping the reader to understand the contemporary world.", "summary": "Best Magazine I've Ever Subscribed To", "unixReviewTime": 1075161600}

Created by a New York publishing company called Harper & Brothers, the periodical received the appropriate name \"Harper's Magazine.\" Over the years, the magazine began printing articles and stories from American authors, including William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser, John Muir, Jack London, and many other big literary names immediately recognizable to readers of literature. Harper's also published news about the big stories of the day, such as an article written by Henry Stimson defending the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Astonishingly enough, the magazine nearly folded in 1980 until several big shots stepped in and rescued the periodical with grant money. Needless to say, Harper's Magazine still chugs along, and I recently subscribed to see what this historic publication looks like today. What I found both elated and bothered me. Harper's Magazine is an entertaining read, if the September 2003 edition is any indication, but at the same time the politics expressed in several of the entries left a slightly sour taste in my mouth.\n\nThe September issue overflows with articles about politics, book reviews, essays, letters from readers, pictures of artwork, and several excerpts from current literary efforts. There is even a doozy of a puzzle towards the end of the magazine for those who want to test their mental powers. It looks as though the editors of the magazine keep advertising to a minimum (a good thing), and there weren't any of those annoying, and sometimes perfumed, inserts you find in most magazines. Nothing kills a magazine quicker in my mind than detecting waves of some cheap cologne wafting off an article about politics or entertainment.\n\nMy favorite odor free articles in this issue of Harper's included a travelogue piece about Waziristan, a rugged region in Pakistan where Taliban exiles mix with hostile Pashtun tribes who possess a decidedly anti-American mentality. The article, written by an American woman, is slightly histrionic in its presentation but it is very informative. Sure enough, a week after I read this article someone on the news mentioned the region in the context of American anti-terrorism efforts, and I was happy to know something about it before hand. Another article worth mentioning is an essay about the public school system written by a retired teacher. The author of this piece derides the crushing boredom of the educational system for both students and teachers, and traces the development of our schools back to Prussia in the 18th and 19th century. While I disagreed with his political leanings, I did find his conclusion that our schools serve as factories to churn out good little sheep that only know how to shop relevant and satisfying. My favorite literary excerpt comes from an Israeli journalist named Oz Shelach, who wrote a book called \"Picnic Grounds.\"  The excerpts come in bite sized little fragments that shed some insight into the problems between the Israelis and Palestinians, among other topics. Some of the stuff in this issue of Harper's Magazine is good reading material.\n\nRegrettably, my politics do not mesh well with the staff at Harper's Magazine. I sighed aloud every time I saw a reference to identity politics, specifically in a literary critique about V.S. Naipaul written by Terry Eagleton. I should be fair and state that I saw a full page advertisement from a group seeking to limit immigration into the United States, and there is a critique of the new Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry that does question the inclusion of several poets who write about nothing except identity themes, so there does seem to be an attempt at balance. Overall, Harper's Magazine is definitely a left oriented publication. I think I can live with it now that I know what to look for in future issues, but for some people this might present a significant problem. One good aspect: while there may be a mess of leftists at the helm of this magazine, at least they still know how to have a laugh. Included in this issue is a description of an Italian board game about women of the night. Based on Monopoly, the Italians call this game \"Puttanopoly,\" and the excerpts taken from the cards in the game are as hilarious as they are inappropriate for this review.\n\nAfter finishing this issue of the magazine, I realized that even though I disagree with its politics, I am still looking forward to receiving my next issue. I read this magazine cover to cover in just a couple of days, and for the most part I felt I learned a lot about various topics in the process. You simply cannot resist the price offered here for a year's subscription, so give Harper's Magazine a chance. No matter what your outlook on life, I guarantee you will find something here to tickle your fancy.", "summary": "Left Oriented Magazine Entertains", "unixReviewTime": 1063324800}

Many of the stories and essays win major literary prizes such as the O'Henry award, and get included in high-profile anthologies such as the *Best American* series.  Certainly, for a writer, if you are chosen to appear in Harper's, you are at the pinnacle of your craft.\nAlthough the New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, and many other smaller literary magazines consistantly offer excellent content and visually pleasing formats, Harper's seems to lead the pack -- maybe because of it's no-nonsense approach, limited advertising, regionally non-specific content, and diversity of topics.

It is a shame that so much in our society from our clothes to sports arenas to television to even the internet has become nothing more advertisements for coporations. Even our favorite celebrities and favorite songs are used to fuel the corporate giant that is run by an unholy desire for greed and profit at the expense of workers.\nMother Jones is independant and one will hear stories you will not hear anywhere else. Certainly not from news channels like Fox and CNN whose opinions range from center-right, conservative, and reactionary. For example, less than 5% of African Americans describe themselves as conservatives, yet 50-60% of African Americans pundits on TV are, you guessed it, conservative Republicans. Understand that there are more Black militants and Black Marxists than Black conservatives. (But don't hold your breath waiting for those guys to appear on Fox's Hannity and the Cowardly Lion)\nAnd as for the previous comment that \"Socialism Kills\", I would like to mention that not every country that claims to be \"Socialist\" actually follows Socialist principles. (And no I am not a Socialist, although I admire certain aspects of Socialism) Just like I'm sure there are and have been many nations that have called themselves Democracies, yet violated human rights, do not follow Democratic principles, etc. For example, wouldn't it be terrible to have a country call itself Democratic, claim it to treat all its citizens equally, but overwhelmingly caters to the richest 5% of the population, overwhelmingly caters to corporate interests and makes its policies around serving those interests, has a one party system that claims to be two parties even though both parties agree on just about everything, a country that has a nasty habit of undermining Democratic, legally elected governments in support of military installed governments and those that have an atrocious human rights record but as long as they are not too left-wing, its ok, a country that has a nasty habit of ignoring international law, the ONLY industrialized nation on earth that has the death penalty even for children, one of the very FEW nations that has not signed the United Nations Declaration of the Right of the Child (the others? Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Etc.we're in good company, the same nations we gave weapons to!), the ONLY nation on Earth condemned as an international terrorist state by the World Court and ordered to pay reparations for our illegal activity in Nicaragua and El Salvador. That country's response? Ignore it. The ONLY industrialized nation on earth that has condemned for violating International Labor standards. A country that inacts inhuman and evil embargoes on third world nations we don't like even if that embargo is condemned by nearly THE ENTIRE WORLD including our most steadfast ALLIES!

Back then, the magazine's tagline was \"REASON - consider the alternative,\" ie, unreason or irrationalism.\n\nAfter the Regan years, the re-focus left Rand behind for economic analysis. This magazine of thought therefore blended Austrian analysis - which was often very rational and ideological - and Chicago school free market or pragmatic 'least harms' libertarianism.\n\nThe latest iteration gained a foothold at Reason in the late 1990s and took over. Many staffers came from the movement magazine \"Liberty,\" edited by its founder R. W. Bradford until his premature death in 2005.\n\nThe claim was that economics didn't relate to many or even most people. But culture did - or could and would. Hence, the frequent push for drug legalization and drug-related stories in Reason. All well and good.\n\nBut in the process, tests of reasonableness - maximizing social utility and minimizing costs somehow left the building. The magazine ceased to be enlightened, reasonable, and enduringly educational.\n\nThat's why I haven't subscribed to Reason in at least a decade. I do look at the newsstand versions. And almost always replace it. You can do better that 'Reason' if you've read a few books - and if you hunger for more, you won't gain much from the magazine.", "summary": "The seasons of 'Reason' show decline", "unixReviewTime": 1417996800}

Yes, it is journalism but it is refreshing and gets away from mainstream, *politically correct* gibberish.

I think it is honest and unbiased and almost reminds me of NPR [National Public Radio] reporting.  You'll find a little of everything here.\n\nFor instance, one of the articles in the issue I just received is another look at *The American Taliban* and his family, etc.  I was amazed since we never heard anything more about the guy after they caught him.  Very interesting article!\n\nThey also had a story about a group of middle-aged Israeli women who monitor the actions of the soldiers in the West Bank...fascinating, humanistic story.\n\nI was completely intrigued by the story of William Zantzinger and Hattie Carroll and the song that Bob Dylan wrote about them back in 1963.  Zantzinger, a white farmer, murdered Carroll, a black maid....and only served 6 months.  He still lives in the same area.  Wonderful story!!!

It was a pleasant company during my laundry at the hotel I have to say! Beautifully designed, with interesting and thought-provoking articles. I am glad I got it, so glad I even got me a subscription. Highly recommendable.\n\nI can say you will always read deep, interesting articles in subjects that, even though they can be Texan or about situations set in that state, always are of universal interest.\n\nOf course, there's the comprehensive \"Around the State\" feature that tells you about all sets of activities going through TX, from sports to ballet, music to art shows. Another mainstay is the Dining Guide, with authoritative reviews of restaurants. They will rotate the reviews, and you might find a recipe of your interest often.\n\nThe semi-editorial \"Behind the Lines\", mostly written by Paul Burka, might tend to discuss either Texas politics or media issues. It's worth a read, because it's always beautifully written.\n\nAnd there are the columns, from the likes of Patricia Kilday Hart, Don Graham, Sarah Bird, and Oscar Casares, from many others. You'll see they will always discuss politics, or art, literature, or their life's experiences.. Or just trying to be plain funny. Bird is not as funny as her predecessor, Governor hopeful Kinky Friedman, but she's well on her way. Casares' pieces are always about his dealings with being a English-speaking Hispanic from the border.\n\nThe \"Texas Monthly Reporter\" is interesting, deals with (yet again) a Texan subject but almost certain to catch everyone's eye: be injured soldiers or a small-town coach who was fired (and her life turned into a misery) because of her sexual orientation.\n\nSkip Hollandsworth, Mimi Swartz, S.C. Gwynne, and many others, will give you features that, in the time of my subscription so far, have been varied and never dull: Dan Rather, the power struggle over Methodist Hospital and Baylor University, Violence in Nuevo Laredo, the unsolved 1960s murder of Irene Garza, Texas road trips, a socialite who paid time in the state penitentiary for ripping off high-end department store Neiman Marcus...\n\nThe topics are so many and even though the first mention of them would not probably make you interested, read on because the quality of the writers and the way they research their subjects, are sure to keep you reading on.\n\nAnd don't forget to check the Texas Monthly Talks section. Editor Evan Smith sits down and chats to interesting people, from Lance Armstrong to many others.\n\nThe photography? Top-notch. They have been able to afford the luxury of hosting names like Mary Ellen Mark, Helmut Newton, Annie Leibovitz, just to name a few.\n\nIt has always made me wonder why this isn't a national magazine, certainly it's better than many others who are distributed across the US. Well, you can always pick up a subscription.\n\nPros: Great articles, photography; comprehensive dining guide.\n\nCons: Too many advertising sections, the perfume samples make it look like Vanity Fair.", "summary": "I like it, and I'm not Texan", "unixReviewTime": 1111881600}

I, too, am a Texas native who has subscribed for nearly 15 years (and read my father's for 10 years before that) and have seen the mag's quality ebb and flo.  As copyKat states, the magazine doesn't seem to know who its target audience is (i.e. upscale, politically savvy, middle-or-the-road, city dweller/suburban, etc.)  The political and investigatory writing is still top-notch.  This state has a lot of problems and the magazine does not try to simply gloss them over.  However, some (ok, many) of the 'fluff' pieces leave me wondering why they were included in the first place.  Like ducksquat, I also dislike having to stop an article in mid-paragraph to hunt down the continuation on page 97.\nI travel throughout the state and appreciate the restaurant reviews and cultural 'to-do' lists.  I also enjoy the mix of current and historical events.  I also very much like Kinky Friedman's Last Roundup (I think I'm in a minority, tho).  The annual Bum Steer Awards are usually worth the subscription price alone.\nMy biggest gripe is with the 20- to 30-page 'special advertising section' every single month.  What used to be a once- or twice-a-year occurance is now in every issue.  I know we (the subscribers) don't keep magazines afloat- the advertisers do - but still...The magazine at times looks (and smells) like my wife's Vogue.\nOverall, Texas Monthly is a good magazine.  The state is so big (physically, culturally and politically) that I am sure it is hard to find a good balance of articles every month.  Other than the politics-only rags like the 'Texas Observer' and the usually horrible 'city' magazines ('D' or 'Inside Houston') TM is all we have; they usually put out a good magazine.  Changes in ownership and editorial staffs over the recent past have slightly changed the magazine's direction every couple of years, but I like the current editing team.  And, Texas Monthly keeps winning awards.\nConsider my, dusksquat's, copykat's, Karen's, and Sheila's reviews before buying a subscription.

Since then, I've returned, though temporarily. It now serves me well to give me ideas of things to do, see and experience.\nMy main qualm with the magazine is that there seems to be as many if not more ads than stories and images. In addition, I'm not quite satisfied that many stories are continued towards the back of the magazine. This merely means that if I don't hold my place, I'll have to strive to find it again.\nIt has been said that everything is big in Texas and the size of the magazine is certainly filled with enough reading material to keep you busy all month long.

While I was expecting a magazine focusing on critical thought, and maybe some philosophy and psychology, I was pretty disappointed because it just seemed to be a political magazine espousing libertarian ideals. While the majority of the magazine was articles discussing why government and regulations are bad, there was one article I really enjoyed in my first issue. It was an interview with Stewart Brand, who I had never heard of before. Interestingly, he actually criticized Reason magazine in the interview. I have to say I respect that the editors of Reason kept that in the magazine. I cancelled after my second issue because it was just more of the same, minus any articles that were interesting to me this time around.\n\nIf you're into Libertarianism, you might actually enjoy this magazine. The articles tend to run on the long side, and can be kind of dry, but they did seem to make an effort to remain fairly objective.\n\nFor those of you looking for a magazine less about politics and more about reason, critical thinking, and thought in general, I would recommend skipping this magazine and checking out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Skeptical-Inquirer/dp/B00006KX3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Skeptical Inquirer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Psychology-Today/dp/B002PXVYNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Psychology Today</a>.", "summary": "Misleading Title", "unixReviewTime": 1286496000}

This was made even more annoying by the fact that I didn't feel any of the articles that gave short shrift to the truth needed to.  One article on invasive species thesis was that we over react to introduction of such.  Agreed.  But it looked at the introduction of such species as if the effect was linear in the number of species.  That is questionable if not flat out false.  Most have little to no effect.  A few have a large effect.  One has to question if the author didn't want to deal with the messiness of real life.  Another article argued that American culture was primarily one of free enterprise citing that 70% of American's thought that.  As far as I could tell that is mostly ascertained through a simple questionnaire.  That is horrible broken methodology.  I suspect a larger number of people in the US think people involved in pro sports should have their salary capped or that officers of private banks should have their salaries controlled.  Neither of which are part of a purely market economy.  So instead of asking the religious question \"do you believe that free markets are the best way to organize our economy, despite severe ups and downs?\" (more surprising is that 30% responded 'no') a methodology that asked questions that measures the depth of ones belief and support of a market economy would lead to a better understanding of our commitment to free enterprise.", "summary": "biased", "unixReviewTime": 1286236800}

Carlson", "reviewText": "There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. So many of them are geared toward a political party, instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. \"Reason\" magazine is the exception, and with its motto that a \"free mind implies a free market\" and vice versa, it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. The authors who write for it definitely have their biases, but they are attentive to these biases, and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound.\n\nMany times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of Reason are \"socially liberal\" but \"fiscally conservative.\" This kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism. But this description is incorrect, for the content of the articles in Reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom, and that means first freedom of the mind, is a moral universal, regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself. The `social liberalism' of Reason, if one is to call it that, manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant. The `fiscal conservatism' of Reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes, impose censorship, or generally violate individual rights.\n\nThere are always many fine articles written in Reason on a diversity of topics. The advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology. One will also find commentary on government waste, propaganda, torture, and the \"war\" on drugs.

But I just can't help being slightly repulsed and even a little embarassed by this magazine- I would hate if someone's first impression of libertarianism was through Reason.\n\nThe magazine lacks focus, which becomes more noticeable when you combine it with the unengaging writing and abomidable formatting/styling so terrible that it would have been hard pressed to earn a D- in my high school graphic design class.\n\nThere are lots of better alternatives, although you'll have to go to magazines that aren't specifically focused on libertarianism in america.  The Economist is great- thorough weekly coverage of the global political climate usually with a \"socially liberal, fiscally conservative\" bent.  Wired is a surprising one- each month it provides great coverage oh how technology is changing the the worlds of politics, culture, and society in general, and most of the writers present a libertarian if \"left wing libertarian\" viewpoint.  The Atlantic has been good too, although its surpringly still considered a liberal magazine- you wouldn't realize it until you flip through the advertisements for hybrid cars and Greenpeace projects.  I think those organizations need to reasess their marketing projects when the magazine now has articles that recognize Rehnquist as one of the best justices of all time, criticize the palestinian independence movement, and show possible republican presidential candidates in positive lights.", "summary": "I wish it was better", "unixReviewTime": 1123459200}

Not every issue is a five star issue, but on the whole Reason is the most interesting periodical on the market.

I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well.\nSo what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area.\nThis is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price.

Though they bill themselves as a resource for IT managers and business people, the magazine is very consumer-oriented, and every issue contains helpful tips for novice users (such as how to get rid of temp files or install the latest Outlook patch).\nAlas, being a jack of all trades condemns you to be a master of none. On average, I only find one or two articles per issue actually useful, and most features lack the depth and technical detail that IT professionals crave (in their defense, and in defense of my high ranking, that one piece of advice I get each month is usually a lifesaver). Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio seems a little too low - one often finds \"special advertising supplements\" where content should be.\nPerhaps my largest issue (no pun intended) with PC World is with its monthly Top 100 list.

Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription.\n\nPC World is good because it's informative and useful.  It covers things you want to know as a PC user.  It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do.  PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users.  If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best.  Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party.", "summary": "Informative, useful", "unixReviewTime": 1105833600}

I never signed up for it or sent anything in, it just started arriving on a free trial basis for about 6 months.  BH is not something I would normally think of subscribing too, but for free, I thought why not.  However it wasn't long before the magazine would arrive in the mail and it would either be flipped through for a couple of minutes and then trashed, or just trashed outright.  It truly was that uninteresting to me. I subscribe to about 4 other magazines and this is the only one I didn't think was worth it, even for free.  The magazine is thick and heavy, but its all Ads.  I mean this magazine starts out with 20 pages of Ads before you even get to the table of contents.  The other reviewer here that talked about it being aggravating the way you have to navigate through all the ADs, cards, and other offers to find the few articles that there are is absolutely right.  A 3 page article can be spread out over a dozen pages just because of the Ads.  The price of this magazine is certainly cheap enough.  On the surface it appears a downright bargain.

Four months away from my renewal date, they informed me they had renewed me \"for my convenience\" and would be charging my debit card.  I promptly canceled my subscription online in November 2009 (would run out in March 2010).  From that point on, I received continual bills with threatening implications, like \"account overdue\" and \"pay immediately.\"  All my account information online stated my subscription was canceled and I owed nothing.  The bills continued to escalate until in Feb. 2010, I searched high and low online to find a phone number to call.  I was informed that the subscription department did not receive information online, and they did not know my subscription was canceled (likely story).  I was informed that NOW they would cancel my subscription.  OK, I'm finally done with these people.  WRONG!!!  Today, I get a threatening e-mail saying my account is past due, and pay my bill immediately.  When I go online, my subscription is canceled, I owe nothing, I have no subscription activity.  What a racket!  I will NEVER, as long as I live, subscribe to this magazine again.  I'm tired of the bait and switch, shady accounting, and threatening tactics toward a customer who paid their bill on time, and would have renewed if treated with some basic courtesy and respect.

I had my doubts. I've heard, over the past few years, horror stories of pages that are difficult to read and navigate as well as difficulty keeping track of what you have and haven't read, etc. Well, after looking through my first Kindle edition of The Weekly Standard, all I can say is I really do love it. I'm surprised that the advertising in the print edition doesn't appear on my Kindle. (I have the paperwhite model, and that might be why. I don't know. Maybe the ads are present on the Fire.) You get a sort of table of contents of the magazine breaking the articles down into sections, i.e., casual, editorial, features, etc. The breakdown tells you how many articles each section contains. Then you just tap the right side of the screen to move through a section, article by article. You are given a word count for each article just under its title, which is nice. And there is a progress bar at the bottom of the screen that graphically represents your progress through the article. Maybe the rest of the world already knew how good e-book magazines had gotten, but I didn't. I'm just delighted. Even the ability to get dictionary definitions of words by pressing on the word you're unsure of works. (And the brainiacs at the Standard love to show off their erudite minds and high IQ's, so you'll appreciate the help.) And I love the monthly subscription. The annual bill of $72 for the print edition always came at the most inconvenient time. A dollar an issue is a good deal. I love the book reviews in the Standard.

If I picked one magazine, it would be The Family Handyman.  The magazine is perfectly titled--targeted at family DIYers--and it constantly delivers content that I am looking for and need.  TFH identifies problems the family patriarch needs to solve and then provides a solution: too much clutter in the garage entry way = step by step on how to build a storage system for your garage.  Lawn looks like exploded hay bales = five ways to repair and maintain your turf.  This could be perception, but I feel like the other magazines miss the topics I desire, or they have a different target: create an ornate 17th century inlaid desk! or look at these fifteen fabulous pictures of other peoples' kitchens!  The Family Handyman often has several articles that interest me, and I find myself setting it aside because I am going to use particular articles as a reference for actual projects.  Even when I search for DIY help online, I often turn to TFH.  One of my favorite features is the inclusion of an automotive article in each issue, which emphasizes the rounded handyman role played by so many men and women.\n\nThe handyman solutions are, as noted, not pretentious and not really aimed at the gifted furniture maker.  I gasped when I first read that I should build a box by butt joining plywood and fastening it with screws.  What?  No dadoes?  No through tenons?  The magazine matches my skill level, and the crafty guy or gal can always embellish a straight-forward project.  The key to making these projects so doable and attractive is the respect for the amount of time the family handyman has.\n\nThe content is the most important aspect of the magazine to me, but I find it helpful that the layout is easy to use, and yes, it is eye-catching.  Few things irritate me more than not being able to find articles buried in a table of contents.  This one is easy to read.  So far, the articles have been easy to discern from the ads, not that I mind ads, I just do not want to hunt for bits of articles hidden in guerrilla advertising.  The plentiful pictures are generally helpful and captioned.\n\nThis is my favorite magazine right now; hence the five stars.", "summary": "Perfectly titled", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600}

This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.\n\nTexas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.\n\nTexas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.\n\nTexas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.\n\nGoing back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.\n\nTexas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.", "summary": "Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State", "unixReviewTime": 1324598400}

The price was within my comfort zone so I let it ride and anticipated a pleasant surprise.\nI wasn't surprised, at least not positively.  But by chance I offered Traveler to a young friend and last year it became her very most favored magazine.  In this the second year of subscribing, I no longer even open the magazine, though it often looks very inviting, but rather quickly pass it directly to this young reader.\nBy giving Traveler a second chance it now earns highest marks.  First it is very visually interesting and appealing to my reader who is totally unfamiliar with the outer world and very eager to see all she can see.  Additionally, the zine teaches as it goes; my young friend is making lists of what to do and expect and is looking up additional information.  And finally, we live in a very remote part of the American West and Traveler is fueling the dreams of this young girl.\nWay to go, folks.  Our kids often fail to dream bigger dreams than this tiny town can fulfill.  Your magazine is helping at least one person reach out and beyond our mountain wilderness.

I liked the magazine at first, with some nice tips here and there, but I decided against renewing.\n\nOne reason for this was their tendency to send expensive books, containing recycled information from the magazine, to me without me actually ordering it.  The first time it happened, I kept the book, as I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning.  The second time, I contacted them and told them to never send me another book.  Also, for this second book, I told them I didn't want to waste my time returning it so they should eat the cost, however they were relentless and started sending notices that they would report me and send my account to collections. I ended up buying that overpriced and unwanted book as well and promptly cancelled everything to do with Family Handyman....\n\nOr so I thought.  Fast forward to Oct 2013 and what do I get in the mail?! Another book!  Unfortunately I will now need to waste my time yet again to return a book I didn't order due to their marketing ploy to milk customers for as much as they can.

They provide a different perspective into social, political and environmental issues that are relevant far beyond the Texas borders.\n\nThe restaurant reviews are spot on and always truthful. I used them as guide in many Texas cities and it never steered me wrong. I especially like when a review is updated and recommends specific dishes. The recipes are easy to make and mouth-watering.\n\nThe cultural reviews make it easy to plan trips across the state and always see something new.\n\nBottom line: Even though I don't live in Texas anymore, I will continue subscribing to Texas Monthly and giving it as a gift for many years.", "summary": "Great Magazine, even for those non-native Texans", "unixReviewTime": 1230508800}

With that longevity, one might think this would be a 5-star review; however, that is not the case.  As a person who loves Texas, I subscribe to virtually all magazines with the word \"Texas\" in their name.  As a result of its extremely liberal, left-wing bias and trash-talking about Texas, I have many times been very close to cancelling my Texas Monthly subscription even before the renewal date.  At the last minute, however, they seem to include a great article on interesting Texas travel destinations, top Texas steak houses, etc. and I'm hooked (tricked?) into sending in another renewal.  It's hard to understand how a liberal blue-state publication survives in one of the reddest states in the Union.  I guess they have enough subscribers from our only blue county (Travis) to support their liberal editorial policy.  I know it's hard to believe but the current editor Of Texas Monthly is a Yankee vegetarian!

Riff box (actually interesting)  Look at ~10 riffs from a genera or artist and teach and explain each.\n7.  Lessons:  good, but usually so detailed and specific you need a PhD. in guitarology to understand.\n8.  hey look, another ad with the guys in staind (they are talented! whatever...)\n9.  new gear\n10. Interviews with people that i don't know, people i wish i didn't know, and finally a good, influencial band (Beach Boys) however no tips.\n11.

So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.\n\nOK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.\n\nYet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.\n\nIn my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.\n\nFrequent travelers on a business or economy budget are likely to hold out for browsing in the dentist office waiting room or - as I do - snagging subscriptions to both via frequent flyer miles.\n\nBon voyage!", "summary": "see the world without getting bruised by it", "unixReviewTime": 1168732800}

It straddles the line between design and practicality.  It takes over where Domino left off and is a new incarnation of House & Garden.  It has none of the haughtiness of AD or monotony of Veranda, nor is it a crafty BH&G.  It does not espouse a traditional, country or contemporary lifestyle, instead each issue runs the gamut of style.  Their interiors articles feature homes that combine design genres and display an individualistic flair, yet there is such a livability to every home featured.  To me, that is the essence of home design.\n\nThe interiors feature stories are written in question/answer format.  No thesaurus worth of adjectives to describe what is featured in the photographs.  They let the designers speak to the interiors, the process, their inspirations and the clients wants and needs.  Simple, direct.  The layouts highlight the photographs, full size, double page spreads, large format and they portray a variety of rooms throughout the house not just a select few.  I find it much more interesting to see how all of the rooms relate to one another and how they translate a design vision throughout.\n\nThis is a rather long review because I simply love this magazine and hope people will give it a try.  So many design magazines have folded in recent years, I want HB to stay.  For those who complain about the number of ads, seriously?  ALL magazines are loaded with ads, thats how they pay for all of those glossy pages  The cost of your subscription doesnt even cover postage and handling. (Note: I don't work for publishers or an ad agency, this is just how it works.)\n\nSome of the other features that I find make it something to look forward to every issue:\n\n1. A kitchen and also a bath of the month feature.  Most design pubs have one issue where they might focus on these rooms or more commonly, they are just one tiny image amongst all of the other lavish photos.  HB provides reference information for some of the highlights in these rooms.  Not the reference where you have to look for the two-point type in the back of the magazine only to find that its To the Trade Only, but actual shopping reference for the average consumer.\n2. Other notable regular columns included in every issue: The Best! dedicated to presenting new products via large format images with minimal copy; a color report with designer recommendations as to use and complementary colors; plus a column each for new wallpaper, fabrics and rugs.  Ive been introduced to so many products I wouldnt have normally been privy to and that are normally only accessible to interior designers.\n3. A new design book is also highlighted every issuenot the postage stamp image with press release blurban actual review/synopsis to peak your interest.\n4. Tablescape.  So often neglected, inspirations for luxurious table settings.  Not the too-cutesy or holiday themed table, but the make every day special because you used distinctive items of exceptional quality.\n\nIm not quite sure when House Beautiful was revamped, but Im happy I gave it another try years after letting my subscription lapse.  I thought I had outgrown it, gave it as a housewarming gift subscription, thumbed through it at giftees home and decided to order my own subscription.  I look forward to every issue and even though I subscribe to numerous design and fashion magazines, this is the one stacked in my library for future reference.", "summary": "Fresh, approachable and consumer oriented", "unixReviewTime": 1362614400}

Asimov's Science Fiction magazine is another time where this is the case.  While I have bought  Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine every month for a while now, I would also check Asimov's to see if it had a Baker story.  If it did, I would buy it.  What I have found, however, is that I have enjoyed most of the other stories in the issues I have bought as well.  Thus, from now on I will be buying it every month too.\n\nMuch like Fantasy & Science Fiction, Asimov's contains mostly science fiction stories of various lengths (short story, novelette, novella) along with a couple of columns and some cartoons.  The difference between the two is that Asimov's contains no fantasy (though some of Mike Resnick's stories have a fantasy feel to them).  However, the magazine likes to concentrate on character-based science fiction, so you won't see a lot of \"technology first, character second\" stories in the magazine.  Personally, I think that's a good thing as hard science fiction turns me off.  If you're more into the hard sciences, you may find stuff in here to interest you, but there's a good chance that you won't.\n\nOccasionally, there will be guest editorials (they printed George R.R. Martin's Guest of Honor speech from Worldcon in the October/November issue).  There's always an \"On Books\" column, sometimes written by Paul Di Filippo, sometimes by Peter Heck.  The authors use this column to recommend books that you may not have come across.  Robert Silverberg opens each issue with a \"Reflections\" column that can cover everything from space exploration to ideas on story-writing.  James Patrick Kelly occasionally is featured with an \"On the Net\" column, examining various science fiction web sites and other online activities.  Unlike Fantasy & Science Fiction, there is often some poetry included as well.  Finally, there is a calendar of upcoming conventions that covers the world so you can always find someplace to go if you need to get together with a group of fans.\n\nThe bread and butter of the magazine, though, are the stories.  Each story has an introduction from the editor (currently Gardner Dozois, though that will change to Sheila Williams with the January issue), which may explain the genesis of the story, or just tell us how long it's been since that author has appeared in Asimov's.  One of the things about Asimov's that is different is that it often serializes stories that will eventually appear in book form.  Allen M. Steele's Coyote series has been serialized over the last couple of years with all of them being collected in two books (Coyote from a couple of years ago, and the upcoming Coyote Rising).  Also, Charles Stross' Accelerando has been featured in recent issues.  The one drawback to this is for readers who only pick up the occasional issue.  For instance, \"Survivor\" in the October/November issue didn't really mean a lot because I've missed everything that came before it.  It does reward regular readers, though.\n\nAsimov's has many writers who write almost exclusively for that magazine, or at the very least the authors submit their stories to this magazine for first refusal.  My favourite, Kage Baker, only seems to appear here, with only one story that I know of appearing in Realms of Fantasy.  Allen M. Steele is another.  Robert Reed seems to be featured everywhere (I swear that guy is churning them out like he's a machine) but he is featured a lot in Asimov's.\n\nThe magazine is bound just like Fantasy & Science Fiction, however the cover is thin paper rather than thicker stock, so it will tear a bit easier.  This does have the advantage that you can sometimes leave it lying open for reading (though this only works if you're toward the middle of it).  It also means it can be rolled up if necessary.\n\nThe only other fault I have with it, and this is strictly a personal thing, is that the stories don't always grab me as much as they do in Fantasy & Science Fiction.  This is mainly because I'm more into fantasy than science fiction, so this certainly wouldn't be the case for everyone.  While the hit and miss ratio varies from issue to issue, I can say that I have never skipped a story in the magazine.  Again, that's a benefit of short fiction.  You're not going to waste a lot of time on them.\n\nIf I had to choose between the two magazines, I would definitely choose Fantasy & Science Fiction.  However, Asimov's is certainly good enough that it's easy to make room for both of them.  Plus, by picking them both up, I feel like I'm doing my part in keeping short fiction alive.  It's only a small part, but every little bit helps.\n\nDavid Roy", "summary": "Some of the best science fiction shorts out there", "unixReviewTime": 1098230400}

A typical Hugo or Nebula awards list usually has several items from Asimov's (although not this year, they're all from sister publication Analog!)  Asimov's tends toward \"softer\" SF than Analog and some stories are more literary or experimental.  But I say this in praise, as most of these stories are well worth the effort.  Some really do take you to alien places or senses with their language and structure as well as plot (I'm thinking of some of Charles Stross' new entries).\nAsimov's is less predictable than Analog as well; other than editor Robert Silverberg's editorial, there are few recurring features, and serialzed novels are rare.  So you may get two short stories or five, the rest made up of novella and novellettes.  But they will always be well-done, and you'll find yourself looking for those authors' long works after enjoying them in Asimov's.\nOne change in publication not mentioned here: both magazines have gone to 10 issues a year from 11, with 2 \"double issues\" instead of one per year.  The double issue is always a treat but then one must wait 2 months for the next regular issue!", "summary": "The best SF is published right here", "unixReviewTime": 1070236800}

It also has the occasional serialized novel. Having been introduced to science fiction through Isaac Asimov's own short story anthologies back in the 70's I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the return to the short story format after many years of \"blockbuster novels\". The magazine consistently showcases the best new talent. It also has a stable of veteran, commercially successful, writers that use the magazine as a vehicle to return to their roots. Notables such as Michael Swanwick, James Patrick Kelly, Kage Baker, and Tom Purdom to name a few. Asimov's seems to always have nominees in the yearly Nebula and Hugo awards for science fiction.\n  Most stories are \"Social Science Fiction\" in which a loose future backdrop is used to tell a character based story with an eventual universal truism revealed. It is rare to find a \"Hard Science Fiction\" story in which the extrapolation of known science into a future setting plays a critical role in the climax and conclusion of the story. Stories from the early writings of Larry Niven are good examples of such stories. This is a forgivable lapse as most editors would tell you that they would love to see more hard science submissions.\n  The magazine also boasts one of the best editorial sections penned by acclaimed author Robert Silverberg. He covers topics ranging from strict science to historical recollections of the science fiction genre. He has also reintroduced many readers to lost stories and authors such as Cordwainer Smith with great biographical pieces.\nThey also have Poems; no offense Mr. Haldeman.", "summary": "The \"Go To \" Sci Fi  Magazine", "unixReviewTime": 1045958400}
